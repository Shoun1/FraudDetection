Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project that implements a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent transactions using a highly imbalanced real-world dataset.

Overview

This project tackles the problem of detecting **credit card fraud** using transaction data containing **284,807 records**, of which only **492 are fraudulent** (a fraud rate of just **0.17%**). Such extreme class imbalance makes traditional models ineffective and highlights the need for careful feature selection, sampling techniques, and evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.

Key Features

- Built using **Logistic Regression**, a fast and interpretable classification algorithm.
- Achieved:
  - **Accuracy:** 99.91%
  - **Precision:** 0.83
  - **Recall:** 0.56
  - **F1-score:** 0.67
- Visualized transaction patterns using correlation matrices and class box plots.

Dataset

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcard)
